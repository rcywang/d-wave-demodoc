*As quantum systems become increasingly complex, optimization algorithms are becoming a requirement for high-precision experiments. MLOO offers an alternative to theoretical models, relying instead on experimental observations to continuously update an internal surrogate model. In this paper, two techniques for efficient and high-quality production of Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) are reviewed:*

    <h3>Statement of Intent: Academic Goals</h3>


*This is an exerpt from my UBC graduate studies (MSc) application for Fall 2021. It contains a detailed description of two of my research areas of interest:*



    High-energy astrophysics
        My post-graduate (BSc) with Dr. Jeremy Heyl was focused on the effects of strong-field QED on polarized emission from isolated neutron stars (NS) -- a phenomenon known as **vacuum birefringence** [#foot2]_. Related to my interest in NSs is determining the full equation of state (EoS) for cold, dense matter (*nuclear physics*). The EoS is incomplete for matter above a critical nuclear saturation density; such matter is thought to exist only in the cores of NSs.
    

    Atomic, molecular, and optical (AMO) physics
        By using ultracold gases as a quantum simulator, I hope to explore the phenomena of **universality** in isolated quantum many-body systems, far from equilibrium. Neutral atom systems are also promising candidates for **scalable quantum computers**. One solution to unwanted crosstalk and low fidelity gates is to encode in the hyperfine states of optically trapped neutral atoms (in a magneto-optical trap or MOT), such as rubidium.

.. [#foot2] In a strongly magnetized vacuum, nonlinear QED interactions induce birefringence; effectively, the propagation speed of photons in the two linear polarization modes (O- and X- modes) differ under these conditions.

    <h3>Quantum Degenerate Gases (Mini-textbook) </h3>

*In preparation for my meeting with Dr. Kirk Madison (head of UBC's Quantum Degenerate Gases (QDG) lab) I wrote this 'mini-textbook' to familiarize myself with the theoretical background and their experimental setup. A detailed study of their atomic and molecular apparatus was useful when discussing what I wanted to investigate for my master's, especially in terms of feasibility.*
