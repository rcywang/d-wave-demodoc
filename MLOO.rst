ML Review Paper
===============
As someone who is interested -- but by no means an expert -- in machine learning, I decided to enter the *Spectra Review Paper competition* on cutting-edge techniques in machine learning (ML). I was inspired by a paper [Wigley2016]_ on the use of ML **online optimization** in the production of Bose-Einstein Condensates (BECs), as my graduate research focus is on cold-atom experiments [#foot1]_. The benefit of entering the competition was two-fold:

    1. In researching the techniques and applications of ML in cold-atom experiments, I learned about various *online optimization* schemes that search for the optimal experimental settings in real-time (or *online*). Perhaps most importantly, I reviewed optimizers (e.g. Nelder-Mead) and optimization methods (e.g. Adam, AdaGrad, RMSProp, etc.) -- both of which are highly relevant for the efficient production of Bose-Einstein Condensates (BECs). In the context of cold-atom experiments, I compared various optimization strategies, using properties such as the convergence rate and the sample size/quality to judge performance.
    2. The two methods I reviewed in depth -- ML online optimization and **single-shot absorption imaging** [Ness2020]_ -- are quite different in their approach. The **Machine-Learning Online Optimization Package (M-LOOP)** is focused on the apparatus itself, using Bayesian optimization to search for the optimal experimental settings. In contrast, the goal of single-shot absorption imaging is to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) after the atomic cloud has been produced. Although this particular imaging sequence does not employ online optimization, the routine can easily be extended to a continuously updated model.
