Demo Documentation for D-Wave Systems
=====================================

Hello! Welcome to my demo documentation for the `Technical Writer / Editor <https://jobs.lever.co/dwavesys/063f504f-9402-4953-9429-cf14452e1436>`_ position at D-Wave Systems. 

This is intended as a display of my documentation style and ability, as well as a resource to learn more about me. Below are some of the most important sections of this doc:

* :ref:`methodology` -- an outline of how I structure my documentation and the reasoning for each of my choices/methods.
* :ref:`install` -- a partial sample of an Installation page, intended to show my structure and formatting.
* :ref:`Additional Writing Samples <quick-links>` -- additional writing samples (including an :ref:`MLOO`), with a brief description of the purpose for each document to provide context.

And finally, 

* :ref:`research` -- a thorough overview of how my research interests and experience align with the work done at D-Wave. This section is perhaps the most important for showcasing my technical understanding. Viewing this section is *strongly encouraged*!
