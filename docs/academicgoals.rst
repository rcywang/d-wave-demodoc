Academic Goals
==============



As part of my Statement of Intent for pursuing graduate studies at UBC, I detailed my :ref:`research experience <resume>`, my :ref:`academic goals <research>`, as well as my :ref:`leadership experience <experience>`. For the "Statement of Academic Goals" section, I was asked to provide a detailed description of my research interests (in up to three research areas). Specifically, I provided background information to suppport my interest in these particular areas, explained what I believe to be the crucial questions to answer in the (sub)field, substantiated what attracted me to the field, and explained how my background positions me to contribute to answering these questions.

This section was judged on the quality of presentation. **Communication skills** are reflected by the clarity of the statement, and also speaks to my research potential and leadership (both potential and demonstrated ability). 


Statement of Intent -- Graduate Research

.. tip::

    In the section on *AMO physics* (page 2), I discuss the potential of neutral atom systems as promising candidates for achieving scalable universal quantum computers, despite the low fidelity of multi-qubit gates. The unique entanglement properties of many-body localized (MBL) states are also a useful tool to study non-equilibrium quantum systems and for storing quantum information.
