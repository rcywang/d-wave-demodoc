.. _QDG:

QDG Mini-textbook
=================

As a study tool (and also out of my own pure enjoyment), I write 'mini-textbooks' for my upper-level classes and other topics of interest. Like Aristotle and Feynman, I consider teaching to be the highest form of understanding; thus, I write these textbooks as if I were explaining it to my future self (which is very useful when studying for exams!). Having a personal reference document, for any topic, has proven time and time again to be invaluable.

As shown in this QDG mini-textbook, I thoroughly review every aspect of a topic -- such as the underlying theory, the experimental apparatus, claims and their corresponding proofs, and even ideas that are tangentially related (to deepen my understanding). Currently, I am reading some of the `group's publications <https://phas.ubc.ca/~qdg/publications/index.html>`_ to stay up-to-date. 

These documents are for personal use, and not for distribution, and so some of the language is somewhat colloquial.
